    "If we think more physically, still in Figure 1b), if the initial velocity of the ball at point B is large enough, when the ball rolls to point D, with momentum, the ball can continue to move up the slope to the left of D. And if we assume the initial velocity is even larger, the ball can go up the slope to point E and then roll down to C as in Figure 1c). This is exactly what we want. Readers may ask whether the ball rolling from A to C follows the momentum to roll to E and then to D. The answer is that this is less likely to happen because compared to slope DE, slope CE is much higher."
