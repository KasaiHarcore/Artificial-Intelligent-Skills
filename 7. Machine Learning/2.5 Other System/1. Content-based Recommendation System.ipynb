    "Physical stores typically have two areas, one is the display area and the other is the warehouse. The obvious rule for achieving high sales is to display the most popular products in visible places and store less popular products in storage. This approach has a clear limitation: the products displayed are popular, not necessarily relevant to a particular customer. A store may have an item that a customer is looking for but it may not be available because the customer cannot see it on the shelf; this results in the customer not being able to access the product even if it is displayed. In addition, because of limited space, the store cannot display all products, but only a small number of each type. Here, the majority of sales (80%) come from a small number of the most popular products (20%). If we arrange the store's products from highest to lowest sales, we will see that it is possible that a small number of products generate the majority of sales; and a long list behind only generates a small amount of contribution. This phenomenon is also known as the long tail phenomenon, which is the long tail of less popular products."

    "Recommendation Systems are often divided into two large groups:\n",
    "- **Content-based systems**: Evaluate the characteristics of recommended items. For example, a user watches a lot of crime movies, then suggest a movie in the database that shares the same criminal characteristics to this user, for example, the movie The Judge. This approach requires arranging items into groups or finding the characteristics of each item. However, there are items that do not have a specific group and determining the group or characteristics of each item is sometimes impossible.\n",
    "- **Collaborative filtering**: The system recommends items based on the correlation (similarity) between users and/or items. It can be understood that in this group, an item is recommended to a user based on users with similar behavior. For example, users A, B, C all like Noo Phuoc Thinh's songs. In addition, the system knows that users B, C also like Bich Phuong's songs but does not have information about whether user A likes Bich Phuong or not. Based on the information of similar users B and C, the system can predict that A also likes Jake and suggest songs by this singer to A."

Therefore, in Recommender Systems, building a Utility Matrix is ​​of utmost importance. However, building this matrix is ​​often difficult. There are two common approaches to determining the rating value for each user-item pair in the Utility Matrix:\n",
    "- **Explicit feedback**: This is when users directly rate items. For example, when users rate movies on Netflix, rate songs on Spotify, or rate products on Amazon. This is the most accurate way to determine the rating value for each user-item pair. However, this approach has a disadvantage: users are often lazy to rate products. Therefore, the number of ratings is often very small compared to the number of products.\n",

For example, the system can infer that a user likes a song if the user listens to the song many times. This approach is often used in cases where users do not rate products. However, this approach is less accurate than the explicit feedback approach."
