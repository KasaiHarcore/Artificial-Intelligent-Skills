    "Libraries that support machine learning mostly only accept input data in numeric form. However, we have seen that with tabular data, very often data fields are stored as categories. Even many data fields are stored in numeric format but are still considered categories. For example, the user ID can be any value, as long as it is not duplicated. They can be numeric values ​​1, 2, 3, … but these values ​​should not be included directly in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that needs to be emphasized is that a good machine learning model is one that returns close output results when the input data (in numerical form) is close to each other. User codes, product codes, or any other type of code that is numbered in random order cannot be considered highly similar when the two codes are close to each other. Even if the codes are intentionally typed, they are only close to each other in one-dimensional space. Information can be defined as being “close to each other” in a higher dimensional space. As another example, let's say the days of the week are numbered 1 (Sunday), (Monday) 2, ..., (Monday) 7; Days 1 and 2 are close to each other, but days 1 and 7 are closer because they are the same weekend. Placing dates as points on a circle in two-dimensional space can yield more value because 1 is close to both 7 and 2.\n",

    "Since each item value is encoded in a vector with only one element equal to 1 at its corresponding position in the dictionary, this vector is called a “one-hot vector”. The dimension of this vector is exactly equal to the number of words in the dictionary. Interpreted in another way, each binary value in this vector represents whether the item value under consideration \"is\" the corresponding value in the dictionary. For new values ​​that are not in the dictionary (out-of-vocabolary or OOV), we can encode them as [0, 0, 0] in the sense that they are not any values ​​in the dictionary."

It is important to note that \"unknown\" is also a possible value in the data set. Encoding unknown values ​​with the same vector can confuse the model that these are two same values. If somehow you know these values ​​will appear a lot in the future, you should specifically include them in the dictionary to have your own encoding, avoiding overlap with other values. If these values ​​rarely occur, we can put them together in one code and consider them to have the same nature as \"rare\". Trying to encode for each rare value will result in having to use a lot of memory and the model will also be more complicated to try to learn unique cases, in which case overfitting can easily occur."

    "One-hot encoding has a major limitation: it is necessary to know the dictionary and its size in advance. This dictionary should also be saved for coding new categories in the future. Imagine an e-commerce store has 1000 items today but in a month from now, that store has 1000 new items. So how should those new items be encoded? Obviously encoding them with a zero vector or with a one-hot vector corresponding to \"unknown\" will reduce model quality because there is no clear distinction between the 1000 new items. At this point, to be able to continue using one-hot encryption, we need to update the dictionary and re-encode all category values. This means that the model's input will change and there is a high possibility that we will also need to change the model's architecture to adapt to the change in input size.\n",

Another characteristic is that different input values ​​will be transformed into integers with different high probability, especially when using a large number of bits.\n",
