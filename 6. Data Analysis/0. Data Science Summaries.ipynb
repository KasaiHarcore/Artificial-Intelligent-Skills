When you combine your business knowledge with mathematics and statistics, you can also analyze the data but you have to do it manually, since you are missing the computational component. When you only combine computer science and statistics, you get machine learning, which is very powerful, but without the necessary business knowledge, you wonâ€™t get any significant information or conclusions. We need to combine all of these three areas, in order to end up with data science."
