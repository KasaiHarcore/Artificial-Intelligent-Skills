    "***Tree-of-Thought*** is an advanced rapid engineering technique that allows an AI system to simulate the process of consulting with multiple experts to solve a complex task. In this approach, the AI ​​system generates feedback from imaginary experts, each of whom provides a step-by-step thought process to solve the task. The system then evaluates and selects the best solution based on the input from these simulated experts.\n",

While Thought COT on guiding the AI ​​system through a linear sequence of steps or thoughts, TOT introduces branching thought paths, similar to a tree structure, in which multiple experts provide diverse approaches to solving the problem."
