    "# Introduction to Zero-shot and Few-shot Prompting\n",
    "Zero-shot prompting and few-shot prompting are advanced techniques in boosting that AI models use to generate answers based on given examples or patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Zero-shot prompting: In zero-shot prompting, no specific examples are provided to the AI ​​model. Instead, the question usually consists of a question or some information, and the model is expected to generate an answer without any previous examples. For example, if you ask ChatGPT a question without providing any examples, it would be considered a zero-shot prompt. The model is expected to generate an answer based only on the context provided in the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Few-shot prompting: In few-shot prompting, a small number of examples are provided to the AI ​​model to guide the process of generating an answer. These examples often follow a pattern like question-answer pairs, and help the model understand the desired output format or style. For example, if a pizza restaurant owner wants ChatGPT to always mention their restaurant name in responses and maintain a certain style, they can provide examples of questions and corresponding answers where the restaurant name is mentioned. The AI ​​model then learns from these examples and generates responses that follow the provided pattern."

    "***Zero-shot prompting***: Ask ChatGPT a question like \"What are the key features of artificial intelligence models?\" without providing any specific examples of features that would be a zero-shot prompt or just providing some general information about the goal to achieve.\n",

    "For example:\n",
    "- Comment: This pizza is probably the best in town. If you’re looking for thin-crusted goodness, you now know where to go. Five stars.\n",
    "- Comment: I loved the pizza, but the overall dining experience was not great. The floor was dirty and the bathroom didn’t have a changing table so I had to change our baby on top of the toilet, which is not ideal.\n",
    "- Comment: Why do restaurants never get my order right? I specifically said I wanted the Supreme Vegetarian and to add pepperoni on top. When I arrived to pick up my order, the person at the counter said they had forgotten to add the pepperoni and asked if I could take the pizza anyway. They didn’t even offer a refund. I said I wanted what I ordered and they went back and made a new pizza. No apologies, and I had to wait 20 minutes longer than necessary. Not great.\n",

    "Additionally, few-shot prompting, in addition to providing questions and answers, can add a step commonly called Intermediate Steps\n",
    "- Intermediate Steps: Provide some intermediate steps between the question and the answer, helping the model better understand the problem-solving process and generate more accurate answers. For example, if you want ChatGPT to generate a tutorial on how to make a pizza, you can provide intermediate steps between choosing ingredients and baking the pizza, helping the model better understand the baking process and generate a detailed and accurate tutorial."
