# 📓 Before dive into this

What I'm trying to do here is summarize everything I know about artificial intelligence. I find out that all the learning sources do not fully give me what I need, so I scrape the internet with all my knowledge, and then I came to this

The project included:
- What is needed to be an A.I Engineer or A.I Researcher
- Every basic concepts, important parts
- Formula and bunch of math
- Coding with and without library
- Diving deep into the world of A.I

Because the wild world of A.I is so big, I can't cover all of it, so I will focus on the most popular models and some of the most important concepts. Also, it can contain some of my personal opinion, so if you have any questions, feel free to contact me or pull a request.

# 💻: Coding
- The coding example is not always working all the time; practice is also the key to mastering the coding skill. 
- Feel free to use ChatGPT, Bard, Claude AI, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, Perplexity, Poe, etc. if you get stuck in the coding part.
 
Some code processes can be wrong because I'm still learning, so if you find any mistakes, feel free to fix them. I'll update everything, as long as I still have interest in this major. (For now, I'm on a graduation project!)

**All the code is not completed yet, I will update it as soon as possible.**
