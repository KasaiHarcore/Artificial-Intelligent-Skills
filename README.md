# All you need to know about this project

What I'm trying to do here is summaries everything I know about Machine Learning

The project included 3 parts:
- Basic concepts about each model
- Formula and some using advantage
- Coding with and without library

Because the wild world of Machine Learning is so big, I can't cover all of it, so I will focus on the most popular models and some of the most important concepts. Also it can contain some of my personal opinion, so if you have any question, feel free to contact me or pull request.

Some code process can be wrong because I'm still learning, so if you find any mistake, feel free to fix it.

**All the code is not completed yet, I will update it as soon as possible**
