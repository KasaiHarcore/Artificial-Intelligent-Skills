# ðŸ““ Before reading my summaries

What I'm trying to do here is summaries everything I know about Machine Learning

The project included three parts:
- Basic concepts about each model
- Formula and some using advantage
- Coding with and without library

Because the wild world of Machine Learning is so big, I can't cover all of it, so I will focus on the most popular models and some of the most important concepts. Also it can contain some of my personal opinion, so if you have any question, feel free to contact me or pull request.

# ðŸ“– Books
- It covering a wide range of mathematical algorithms and coding. I will provide detail Book to read below:

# ðŸ’»: Coding
- The coding example not always working all the time, also practice is the key to master the coding skill. 
    - Reach and follow some online Course on Coursera or Youtube: I will prefer Coursera because it has a lot of good course and you can get a certificate after finishing the course.
    - Leetcode, Hackerrank and Kaggle is a good place to practice your coding skill.
    - Feel free to using ChatGPT, Bard, Claude AI if you stuck in the coding part.
 
Some code process can be wrong because I'm still learning, so if you find any mistake, feel free to fix it.

**All the code is not completed yet, I will update it as soon as possible.**
