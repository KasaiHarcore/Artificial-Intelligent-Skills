# All you need to know about this project

What I'm trying to do here is summaries everything I know about Machine Learning

The project included 3 parts:
- Basic concepts about each model
- Formula and some using advantage
- Coding with and without library


**All the code is not completed yet, I will update it as soon as possible**
