    "# Linear Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theory:** Linear regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) by fitting a linear equation. It assumes that this relationship can be represented as a straight line, which is the simplest form of regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:** The formula for a simple linear regression (with one feature) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y = mx + b$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $y$ is the target variable.\n",
    "- $x$ is the feature variable.\n",
    "- $m$ is the slope (coefficient) of the line.\n",
    "- $b$ is the y-intercept.\n",
    "\n",
    "For multiple linear regression (with more than one feature), the equation extends to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + \\ldots + b_px_p$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $y$ is the target variable.\n",
    "- $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_p$ are the feature variables.\n",
    "- $b_0, b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_p$ are the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost Function (aka Lost function):\n",
    "\n",
    "$J_{(w)} = \\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_{w}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a formula to calculate the right coefficients for the linear regression model. It is called the Normal Equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{\\theta} = (X^T \\cdot X)^{-1} \\cdot X^T \\cdot y$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\hat{\\theta}$ is the value of $\\theta$ that minimizes the cost function.\n",
    "- $y$ is the vector of target values containing $y^{(1)}$ to $y^{(m)}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support Functions:** Linear regression typically uses the least squares method to find the coefficients that minimize the sum of squared errors between the predicted and actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Simplicity and interoperability: Easy to understand and explain.\n",
    "- Works well for linear relationships in data.\n",
    "- Quick to train and apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Assumes a linear relationship, which may not hold in all cases.\n",
    "- Sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "- Limited to modeling linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use:**\n",
    "- Use linear regression when you suspect a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables.\n",
    "- It's commonly used for tasks like predicting house prices, stock prices, or any continuous numerical value based on input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to ask if you'd like more details or have specific questions about linear regression.\n",

    "# Logistic Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theory:** Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for binary and multi-class classification tasks. Despite its name, it's a classification algorithm rather than a regression algorithm. Logistic Regression models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class.\n",

    "**How It Works:**\n",
    "- Logistic Regression uses the logistic (sigmoid) function to model the probability of the positive class (class 1).\n",

    "- Why we not using a linear function for classification?\n",
    "- Because the linear function can give us a value that is not in the range of 0 to 1. When we derivative the linear function, we will get a constant value. So, we can't use the gradient descent to find the minimum value of the cost function.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Theory:** K-Nearest Neighbors is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It's based on the principle that data points with similar features tend to be close to each other in the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works:**\n",
    "- For classification: When you want to classify a new data point, KNN looks at the K nearest data points in the training dataset, we calculate the distance, try to minimize the distance, and then we group all the data point into a group then assigns the majority class among those K neighbors to the new point.\n",
    "- For regression: KNN predicts a continuous target variable by averaging or weighting the target values of the K nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support Functions:** KNN doesn't rely on specific formulas or equations. Instead, it involves distance metrics (typically Euclidean distance) to measure the similarity between data points and identify the nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Simple and easy to understand.\n",
    "- No training phase; it's instance-based.\n",
    "- Works well for non-linear relationships.\n",
    "- Can be used for both classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Computationally expensive, especially with large datasets.\n",
    "- Sensitivity to the choice of the number of neighbors (K).\n",
    "- Doesn't perform well when feature scales are significantly different.\n",
    "- May not handle high-dimensional data effectively (curse of dimensionality).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "- Euclidean Distance: The most commonly used distance metric in KNN is Euclidean distance. It is defined as the square root of the sum of squared differences between two data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ d(x, y) = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - y_i)^2} $$\n",

    "- $p$ is a parameter that determines the type of distance metric. When $p=1$, it is equivalent to Manhattan distance. When $p=2$, it is equivalent to Euclidean distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use:**\n",
    "- Use KNN when you have a small to moderately sized dataset and you want to make predictions based on similarity to existing data points.\n",
    "- It's commonly used in recommendation systems, image recognition, and anomaly detection.\n",
    "\n",

SVMs are known for their ability to handle both linear and non-linear classification problems efficiently. They work by finding the optimal hyperplane (or hyperplanes) that best separates data points of different classes in feature space. Here are the key components and concepts related to Support Vector Machines:\n",

    "# Multi-class SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theory:**\n",
    "A Multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) is an extension of the traditional binary SVM to handle classification problems with more than two classes. In multi-class SVM, the goal is to assign each data point to one of several possible classes or categories. Several strategies can be employed to extend binary SVM to multi-class problems, such as one-vs-all (OvA), one-vs-one (OvO), and softmax-based approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro:**\n",
    "- Multi-class SVMs are a powerful tool for multi-class classification tasks, as they can handle complex decision boundaries and non-linearly separable data.\n",

    "Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning and statistical modeling where a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and random fluctuations rather than the underlying patterns or relationships in the data. This can lead to poor generalization performance, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen or new data. Let's explore overfitting in more detail:\n",

    "**Causes of Overfitting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complex Models:** Models with a high number of parameters (e.g., deep neural networks) have a higher capacity to fit the training data precisely. While this can be beneficial, it also increases the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Insufficient Data:** When the training dataset is small, models may struggle to generalize because they have limited examples to learn from.\n",

    "**Effects of Overfitting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High Training Accuracy, Low Test Accuracy:** Overfit models typically achieve high accuracy on the training data but perform poorly on new or unseen data.\n",

    "2. **Poor Generalization:** The model may fail to generalize to different datasets, real-world scenarios, or unseen examples.\n",

    "3. **Unstable Predictions:** Small changes in the input data can lead to significant variations in the model's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods to Prevent or Mitigate Overfitting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cross-Validation:** Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess the model's performance on different subsets of the data and detect overfitting.\n",

    "3. **Simpler Models:** Choose simpler model architectures or reduce the complexity of existing models if the problem doesn't warrant complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **More Data:** Collect more data if possible, as larger datasets can help the model generalize better.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Feature Selection:** Carefully select and preprocess features, removing irrelevant or redundant ones.\n",

    "6. **Early Stopping:** Monitor the model's performance on a validation set during training and stop when the performance starts to degrade.\n",

    "\n",
    "**1. Convex Sets:**\n",
    "   - A set is convex if, for any two points in the set, the line segment connecting them lies entirely within the set.\n",
    "   - Convex sets have a critical property: if a local minimum exists within a convex set, it is also a global minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Convex Functions:**\n",
    "   - A function $f(x)$ is convex if, for any two points $x$ and $y$ in its domain and for all $\\lambda$ in the interval $[0, 1]$, the following inequality holds:\n",
    "   \n",
    "     $$f(\\lambda x + (1 - \\lambda) y) \\leq \\lambda f(x) + (1 - \\lambda) f(y)$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Convex functions have properties like non-negative second derivatives, non-decreasing gradients, and their epigraphs (the region above the function's graph) are convex sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Convex Optimization Problems:**\n",
    "   - A convex optimization problem is defined as follows:\n",
    "   \n",
    "     $$\\text{Minimize } f(x) \\text{ subject to } g_i(x) \\leq 0 \\text{ for } i = 1, 2, \\ldots, m$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Here, $f(x)$ is a convex objective function, and $g_i(x)$ are convex inequality constraints.\n",
    "   - Convex optimization problems can also include equality constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Algorithms for Convex Optimization:**\n",
    "   - There are various algorithms for solving convex optimization problems, including gradient descent, interior-point methods, and sub gradient methods.\n",
    "   - These algorithms exploit the structure of convexity to efficiently find global optima.\n",
    "   - Interior-point methods, in particular, are popular for solving large-scale convex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Applications:**\n",
    "   - Convex optimization has applications in diverse areas, such as linear programming (LP), quadratic programming (QP), support vector machines (SVMs), portfolio optimization, and robust control.\n",
    "   - In machine learning, convex optimization is used for training linear models (e.g., linear regression and logistic regression) and support vector machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Duality:**\n",
    "   - Convex optimization problems often have associated dual problems, which provide a lower bound on the optimal value of the original problem.\n",
    "   - Strong duality holds for convex problems, meaning that the optimal value of the dual problem is equal to the optimal value of the primal problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Computational Complexity:**\n",
    "   - Convex optimization problems are generally efficiently solvable in polynomial time.\n",
    "   - This computational tractability distinguishes convex optimization from non-convex optimization, where finding global optima can be NP-hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convex optimization is a powerful framework for solving a wide range of real-world problems. Its applications extend beyond optimization theory to fields where optimization plays a crucial role in decision-making and resource allocation. Researchers and practitioners leverage convexity to design efficient algorithms and models for solving complex problems."

    "Duality is a fundamental concept in optimization theory that is particularly important in convex optimization. It provides a powerful tool for understanding and solving optimization problems, especially when dealing with convex optimization problems. Duality introduces the idea of creating a \"dual\" problem associated with the original \"primal\" problem, which can provide valuable insights and solutions. Let's explore the concept of duality in more detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primal Problem:**\n",
    "- The original optimization problem, which we aim to solve, is referred to as the \"primal\" problem.\n",
    "- In the primal problem, we have an objective function to minimize or maximize, subject to certain constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dual Problem:**\n",
    "- The \"dual\" problem is a related optimization problem that is derived from the primal problem.\n",
    "- It is constructed in such a way that it provides a lower bound (in minimization) or an upper bound (in maximization) on the optimal value of the primal problem.\n",
    "- The dual problem involves introducing Lagrange multipliers or dual variables for each constraint in the primal problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lagrangian and Lagrange Dual Function:**\n",
    "- The Lagrangian is a function that combines the objective function of the primal problem with the constraints, using Lagrange multipliers.\n",
    "- The Lagrange dual function is the infimum (the greatest lower bound) of the Lagrangian over all feasible points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weak Duality:**\n",
    "- Weak duality is a fundamental property that states that the optimal value of the dual problem is always a lower bound on the optimal value of the primal problem.\n",
    "- Mathematically, if \\(p^*\\) is the optimal value of the primal problem, and \\(d^*\\) is the optimal value of the dual problem, then \\(d^* \\leq p^*\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strong Duality:**\n",
    "- Strong duality is a more specific property that holds when the primal and dual problems have the same optimal value.\n",
    "- In other words, if \\(p^* = d^*\\), then strong duality is satisfied.\n",
    "- Strong duality is a special property that holds for convex optimization problems but may not hold for non-convex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) Conditions:**\n",
    "- The KKT conditions are a set of necessary conditions for optimality in both the primal and dual problems.\n",
    "- These conditions include the gradient of the Lagrangian being zero, complementary slackness, and feasibility constraints.\n",
    "- Satisfying the KKT conditions is a requirement for optimality in convex optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications of Duality:**\n",
    "- Duality is a powerful tool for sensitivity analysis in optimization, allowing us to understand how changes in problem parameters affect the optimal solution.\n",
    "- It is used in various optimization algorithms, including interior-point methods for convex optimization.\n",
    "- Duality is also applied in economics, game theory, and engineering for modeling and solving complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, duality is a central concept in optimization that allows us to derive a related dual problem from a primal problem. It provides valuable insights into the nature of optimization problems, establishes bounds on solutions, and plays a crucial role in solving and analyzing convex optimization problems. Strong duality is a key property that distinguishes convex optimization from non-convex optimization, where finding the global optimum can be more challenging."

Neighborhood-Based CF specifically focuses on finding these \"neighborhoods\" of users or items to make recommendations.

    "- Different with Grid Search and Random Search, Bayesian Optimization is a technique for hyperparameter tuning that works by constructing a probabilistic model of the objective function, and then using this model to select the next hyperparameter values to evaluate. It is used to improve the performance of machine learning models when the dataset is imbalanced.\n",

    "**Normalization:**\n",
    "- Normalization is a technique often applied as part of data preparation for machine learning. The goal of normalization is to change the values of numeric columns in the dataset to a common scale, without distorting differences in the ranges of values or losing information.\n",
    "- Normalization is also required for some algorithms to model the data correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Normalization Techniques:**\n",
    "- **Min-Max Normalization:** Min-max normalization scales the values in the range [0, 1]. This is done by subtracting the minimum value in the feature and then dividing the result by the difference between the original maximum and original minimum value in the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ x_{norm} = \\frac{x - x_{min}}{x_{max} - x_{min}} $\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Z-Score Normalization:** Z-score normalization scales the values so that the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1. This is done by subtracting the mean value from each data point and then dividing the result by the standard deviation of the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ x_{norm} = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} $\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Log Transformation:** Log transformation is used to transform skewed data to approximately conform to normality. It can be used to normalize data that contains negative values, as long as the data is shifted by a constant value (e.g., by adding the absolute value of the most negative value in the data).\n",

It is caused by the model's inability to represent the underlying pattern of the data. Bias error can be reduced by increasing the model's complexity (e.g., by adding more features or using a more complex model).\n",
    "- **Variance Error:** Variance error is the variability of the model's predictions. It is caused by the model's sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set. Variance error can be reduced by increasing the size of the training set (e.g., by collecting more data or using data augmentation).\n",
    "- **Irreducible Error:** Irreducible error is the error that cannot be reduced by improving the model. It is caused by the noise in the data. Irreducible error can be reduced by removing outliers from the training set (e.g., by using outlier detection techniques).\n",
