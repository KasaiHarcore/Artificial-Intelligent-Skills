    "\n",
    "Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. It supports different programming approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the popular approaches to solve a programming problem is by creating objects. This is known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **“objects”**. The object contains both data and code: Data in the form of properties (often known as attributes), and code, in the form of methods (actions object can perform).\n",
    "\n",
    "An object has two characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* attributes\n",
    "* behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "A parrot is can be an object,as it has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* name, age, color as attributes\n",
    "* singing, dancing as behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of OOP in Python focuses on creating reusable code. This concept is also known as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).\n",

    "### Class \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, everything is an object. A class is a blueprint for the object. To create an object we require a model or plan or blueprint which is nothing but class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create class to create an object. A class is like an object constructor, or a \"blueprint\" for creating objects. We instantiate a class to create an object. The class defines attributes and the behavior of the object, while the object, on the other hand, represents the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class represents the properties (attribute) and action (behavior) of the object. Properties represent variables, and actions are represented by the methods. Hence class contains both variables and methods.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of class as a sketch of a parrot with labels. It contains all the details about the name, colors, size etc. Based on these descriptions, we can study about the parrot. Here, a parrot is an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class classname:\n",
    "    '''documentation string'''\n",
    "    class_suite\n",
    "```\n",
    "* **Documentation string:** represent a description of the class. It is optional.\n",
    "* **class_suite:** class suite contains component statements, variables, methods, functions, attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example for class of parrot can be :\n",

    "```python\n",
    "class Parrot:\n",

    "## Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, **[inheritance](https://github.com/milaan9/06_Python_Object_Class/blob/main/003_Python_Inheritance.ipynb)** is the process of inheriting the properties of the base class (or parent class) into a derived class (or child class).\n",
    "\n",
    "In an Object-oriented programming language, inheritance is an important aspect. Using inheritance we can reuse parent class code. Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from parent class. The parent class or super or base class is the class which gives all the methods and properties. Child class is the class that inherits from another or parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In inheritance, the child class acquires and access all the data members, properties, and functions from the parent class. Also, a child class can also provide its specific implementation to the functions of the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use of inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of inheritance is the reusability of code because we can use the existing class to create a new class instead of creating it from scratch.\n",

    "In the above example, we created two classes called **`Circle`** and **`Rectangle`**. In both classes, we created the same method with the name **`calculate_area`**. This method acts differently in both classes. In the case of the **`Circle`** class, it calculates the area of the circle, whereas, in the case of a **`Rectangle`** class, it calculates the area of a rectangle."

    "1. Python has the module called **`statistics`** and we can use this module to do all the statistical calculations. However, to learn how to make function and reuse function let us try to develop a program, which calculates the measure of central tendency of a sample (**`mean`**, **`median`**, **`mode`**) and measure of variability (**`range`**, **`variance`**, **`standard deviation`**). In addition to those measures, find the **`min`**, **`max`**, **`count`**, **`percentile`**, and **`frequency distribution`** of the sample. You can create a class called **`statistics`** and create all the functions that do statistical calculations as methods for the **`statistics`** class. Check the output below.\n",
