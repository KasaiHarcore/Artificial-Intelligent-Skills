# Build a Tic-Tac-Toe Game With Python and Tkinter

This code I made based on Real Python tutorial [Build a Tic-Tac-Toe Game With Python and Tkinter](https://realpython.com/tic-tac-toe-python/). It allows two players to play a tic-tac-toe game on a shared device. Currently I'm working on a single player mode.
