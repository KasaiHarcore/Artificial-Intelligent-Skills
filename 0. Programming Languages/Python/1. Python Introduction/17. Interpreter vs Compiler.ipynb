    "\n",
    "An interpreter is a computer program, which coverts each high-level program statement into the machine code. This includes source code, pre-compiled code, and scripts. Both compiler and interpreters do the same job which is converting higher level programming language to machine code. However, a compiler will convert the code into machine code (create an exe) before program run. Interpreters convert code into machine code when the program is run.\n",

    "\n",
    "## What is Compiler?\n",
    "\n",
    "A compiler is a computer program that transforms code written in a high-level programming language into the machine code. It is a program which translates the human-readable code to a language a computer processor understands (binary 1 and 0 bits). The computer processes the machine code to perform the corresponding tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A compiler should comply with the syntax rule of that programming language in which it is written. However, the compiler is only a program and cannot fix errors found in that program. So, if you make a mistake, you need to make changes in the syntax of your program. Otherwise, it will not compile.\n",

    "### HIGH-LEVEL LANGUAGES\n",

(eg. 110110) It represents the simple operations which should be performed by the computer. Machine language programs are executable so that they can be run directly.\n",

    "On compilation of source code, the machine code generated for different processors like Intel, AMD, an ARM is different. To make code portable, the source code is first converted to Object Code. It is an intermediary code (similar to machine code) that no processor will understand. At run time, the object code is converted to the machine code of the underlying platform.\n",
