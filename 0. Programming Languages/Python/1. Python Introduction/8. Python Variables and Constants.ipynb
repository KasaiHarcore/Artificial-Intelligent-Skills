    "A variable is a named location used to **store data in the memory**. Variable also known as **identifier** and used to hold value. It is helpful to think of variables as a container that holds data that can be changed later in the program. **Mnemonic** variables are recommended to use in many programming languages. A mnemonic variable is a variable name that can be easily remembered and associated. A variable refers to a memory address in which data is stored. For example,\n",
