    "A data frame is a type of structure that contains correlated information. So for example, a data frame would be a great structure for storing these movie titles along with their corresponding years.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We need to use the data.frame() function to create a data frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "movies <- data.frame(name = c(\"Toy Story\", \"Akira\", \"The Breakfast Club\", \"The Artist\", \"Modern Times\"),\n",
    "                     year = c(1995, 1998, 1985, 2011, 1936),\n",
    "                     stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n",

    "- To get some information about the data frame’s structure, you can pass the data frame as an argument to the “str” function.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The “head” and “tail” function can be used to look at the beginning and end of a data frame, respectively. The “head” function will display the first six elements, and the “tail” function will display the last six elements.\n",
    "\n",

    "head(movies)\n",
