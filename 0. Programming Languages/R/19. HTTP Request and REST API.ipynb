    "# HTTP Request and REST API\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTTP Request (HyperText Transfer Protocol)\n",
    "- HTTP is probably the most used communication protocol for fetching web resources for clients from servers on the Internet. A resource can include a web page, media files, including images and video clips, or even a csv file containing a dataset. HTTP is a request-response protocol. A client submits an HTTP request to the server, and the server returns a response to the client. The response contains status information about the request and may also contain the requested content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some popular HTTP methods are:\n",
    "    - GET: retrieve information from the specified source (you just saw this one!)\n",
    "    - POST: send new information to the specified source.\n",
    "    - PUT: update existing information of the specified source.\n",
    "    - DELETE: remove existing information from the specified source.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't know, URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is a specific type of Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), although many people use the two terms interchangeably. URLs occur most commonly to reference web pages (http), but are also used for file transfer (ftp), email (mailto), database access (JDBC), and many other applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTTP Response\n",
    "- The first line of a response message is the status line, which contains the protocol version followed by a numeric status code and its associated textual phrase. The phrases shown are typical, but any human-readable alternative may be provided. HTTP status codes are extensible and HTTP applications are not required to understand the meaning of all the registered status codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some popular status codes are:\n",
    "    - 200 OK: Standard response for successful HTTP requests.\n",
    "    - 404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future.\n",
    "    - 403 Forbidden: The request was valid, but the server is refusing action.\n",
    "    - 500 Internal Server Error: A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## REST API (Representational State Transfer)\n",
    "- REST is an architectural style for developing applications that can be accessed over the network. It is a set of rules that allow programs to talk to each other. The developer of the API decides how the API endpoints should look like, and the API consumer decides which endpoints to use and how to use them. REST APIs use HTTP methods to perform different operations. REST APIs are stateless, meaning that calls can be made independently of one another, and each call contains all of the data necessary to complete itself successfully.\n",

    "## httr: R HTTP request / REST package\n",
    "- httr is designed to map closely to the underlying http protocol.\n",
    "- A popular HTTP package for R\n",
    "- Easy to use\n",
