    "## Conditional\n",
    "- Suppose that you have a group of movies in a dataset, like the one you see here, and you want to only select the movies released after the year 2000. To do this, we’re going to have to rely on a conditional statement. In other words, we need to examine the dataset row by row, and check if the year value is greater than 2000 or not. In R, we can use an “if” statement to accomplish this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "if (condition) {\n",
    "  # do something (if condition is TRUE)\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "    # do something else (if condition is FALSE)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will see that how familiar this syntax is if you have used other programming languages before like Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## For loops\n",
    "- Let's us take an example, where we want to print the numbers from 1 to 5. We can do this using a for loop. In R, we can use a for loop to iterate over a vector, a list, or a data frame. In this case, we want to iterate over a vector of numbers from 1 to 5. We can do this using the colon operator, which is a shortcut for creating a vector of numbers. We can then use the for loop to iterate over the vector and print each number.\n",
    "\n",

    "for (val in vector) {\n",
    "  # do something\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Like python, the loop can be contain some conditional statement, even new vector, list, variable can be created inside the loop.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## While loops\n",
    "- While loops are similar to for loops, except that the loop is executed while a certain condition is true. For example, we can use a while loop to print the numbers from 1 to 5. We can do this by first initializing a variable to 1, and then using a while loop to print the value of the variable, and then incrementing the variable by 1. We can then use a while loop to print the value of the variable, and then incrementing the variable by 1. We can then use a while loop to print the value of the variable, and then incrementing the variable by 1. We can then use a while loop to print the value of the variable, and then incrementing the variable by 1. We can then use a while loop to print the value of the variable, and then incrementing the variable by 1. We can then use a while loop to print the value of the variable, and then incrementing the variable by 1. We can then use a while loop to print the value of the variable, and then incrementing the variable by 1. We can then use a while loop to print the value of the variable, and then incrementing the variable by 1. We can then use a while loop to print the value of the variable, and then incrementing the variable by 1.\n",
