    "A common file format for structured data is CSV, which stands for comma separated values. CSV files store the data in a table format, and in each row, every column value is separated by a delimiter. As the name would suggest, this delimiter is traditionally a comma. In order to read a CSV data file, all we need to do is call the “read.csv” function while passing in the path to the file. The function will return a DataFrame object, which we can then manipulate as we please.\n",
