    "# Error Catching\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try to perform an invalid operation, R will alert you with the appropriate error message. Consider the piece of code here:\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "\"a\" + 10\n",
    "\n",
    "# Error in \"a\" + 10 : non-numeric argument to binary operator\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we’re trying to add a character type and a number together. When run, we see in the error output that one of the arguments is non-numeric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or when it running in a loop like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "for (i in 1:10) {\n",
    "  print(i + \"2\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Error in i + \"2\" : non-numeric argument to binary operator\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that, suppose the loop will run 10 times, the first time it will print 12, but the second time it will throw an error because we’re trying to add a character type and a number together.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how can we deal with this ? There is a method call tryCatch() that can help us to catch the error and do something else instead of throwing the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "tryCatch(10 + \"a\", error = function(e) print(\"Oh no, something wrong\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "# [1] \"Oh no, something wrong\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "tryCatch(10 + 10, error = function(e) print(\"Oh no, something wrong\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "# [1] 20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can see, only the error will trigger the function inside the tryCatch().\n",
    "\n",
    "Beside of error, warning is another type of message that can occur when running a piece of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "as.numeric(\"a\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Warning message:\n",
    "# NAs introduced by coercion\n",
    "\n",
    "tryCatch(as.numeric(\"a\"), warning = function(w) print(\"Oh no, something wrong\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "# [1] \"Oh no, something wrong\"\n",
    "```"
