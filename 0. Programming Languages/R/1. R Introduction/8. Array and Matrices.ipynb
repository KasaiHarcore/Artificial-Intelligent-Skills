    "# Arrays\n",
    "- A single or multidimensional structure containing data of the same type (strings, characters, integers, floats, etc.). Arrays can also be **multidimensional**, such as a 2 x 2 x 2 array.\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "# Create an array\n",
    "movie_vector <- c(\"Toy Story\", \"Akira\", \"The Breakfast Club\", \"The Artist\", \"Modern Times\")\n",
    "movie_vector <- array(movie_vector, dim = c(2, 3, 2))\n",

    "## What is the difference between an array and a vector?\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors are always one dimensional like a single row of data. On the other hand, an array can be multidimensional (stored as rows and columns). The \"dimension\" indicates how many rows of data there are.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let's see another example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "movie_array <- array(movie_vector, dim = c(4,3))\n",
    "movie_array\n",
    "\n",
    "#      [,1]                  [,2]                  [,3]\n",
    "# [1,] \"Toy Story\"            \"The Breakfast Club\" \"Modern Times\"\n",
    "# [2,] \"Akira\"                \"The Artist\"         \"Toy Story\"\n",
    "# [3,] \"The Breakfast Club\"   \"Modern Times\"       \"Akira\"\n",
    "# [4,] \"The Artist\"           \"Toy Story\"          \"The Breakfast Club\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that **arrays are created column-wise**. Did you also notice that there were only 9 movie names, but the array was 4 x 3? The original **vector doesn't have enough elements** to fill the entire array (that should have 3 x 4 = 12 elements). So R simply fills rest of the empty values by going back to the beginning of the vector and starting again (\"Akira\", \"Toy story\", \"Room\" in this case)."
