    "# Vector and Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vectors\n",
    "- A vector is a one-dimensional array of objects, and it's the simplest type of data structure in R. There is no restriction on the type of data that can be stored in a vector, but all elements must be of the same type (i.e., all numbers or all character strings).\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "# Create a vector of numbers\n",
    "num <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a vector of strings\n",
    "str <- c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a vector of logicals\n",
    "log <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a vector of mixed data types\n",
    "mix <- c(1, \"b\", TRUE, 4+5i)\n",
    "\n",
    "c(1:10) # Create a vector of numbers from 1 to 10\n",
    "\n",
    "c(10:1) # Create a vector of numbers from 10 to 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical Vectors\n",
    "- A logical vector is a vector that contains TRUE and FALSE values. You can create a logical vector using the logical operators > (greater than), < (less than), == (equal to), >= (greater than or equal to), <= (less than or equal to), and != (not equal to).\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "# Create a vector of numbers\n",
    "num <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a logical vector\n",
    "num > 3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a logical vector\n",
    "num == 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Factors\n",
    "- Factor is a data structure used for categorical variables. Factors are useful in statistical modeling and graphics. They can be ordered or unordered. Factors are stored as integers, and have labels associated with these unique integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "# Create a vector of strings\n",
    "str <- c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a factor\n",
    "factor(str)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a factor with ordered levels\n",
    "factor(str, ordered = TRUE, levels = c(\"e\", \"d\", \"c\", \"b\", \"a\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Factor Levels\n",
    "- Factor levels are the unique values that a factor can take. By default, the first level is assigned a value of 1, the second a value of 2, and so on. You can assign a specific value to each level, or you can let R automatically assign values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ordered Factors\n",
    "- An ordered factor has levels that can be arranged in a meaningful order. For example, the factor levels \"low\", \"medium\", and \"high\" can be arranged in a meaningful order. You can create an ordered factor using the ordered() function."
