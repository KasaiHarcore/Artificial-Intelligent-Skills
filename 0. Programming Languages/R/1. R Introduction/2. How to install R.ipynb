    "The main source for R is the **[Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org)**. You can get the source code and compile it yourself, but you may prefer at this point to download and install a precompiled version. You can download precompiled binaries for most major platforms from any CRAN mirror. To do so, go to https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html and find a mirror site that is geographically somewhat near you. Find the appropriate page for your operating system, and read and follow the installation instructions. Be sure to install the latest version."

    "The standard distributions of R include several packages: user-contributed suites of add-on functions. These notes use some additional packages which you will have to install before using. In the Windows version additional packages can be installed easily from within R using the Packages menu. Under all platforms, you can use the commands install.packages() and update.packages() to install and update packages, respectively. Most packages are available pre-compiled for MacOS X and Windows; under Linux, R will download and compile the source code for you."
