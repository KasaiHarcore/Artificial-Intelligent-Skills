    "R has a specialized object class for holding dates of a calendar. The output here may simply look like strings, but R actually represents a date as the number of days since January 1 of 1970. This particular representation for dates has become a standard across computer environments. And as a special note, the dates are based off of the Gregorian calendar.\n",

    "We can see that the date of birth is represented as a number. This is the number of days since January 1, 1970. We can convert this to a date object using the as.Date() function or the as.POSIXct() function. The as.Date() function will return a date object, while the as.POSIXct() function will return a date time object. The as.POSIXct() function is useful if you want to include the time of day as well.\n",
