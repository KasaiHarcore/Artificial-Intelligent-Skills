# CMD - Command Cheat Sheet ‚úÖ

Windows Command Prompt is an often ignored aspect of the modern Windows OS. The command prompt, also known as cmd.exe or cmd is a command line interpreter available since the NT line of Windows OS. While the majority reasons for which the command prompt was used for can now be done through a graphical interface, this application has remained with Windows and is still used by many. Although many of us might not have used them, the fact that they still exist in modern day Windows is reason enough for us to be familiar with it.

While the commands in Windows 11, 10, 8, 7, Vista, and XP are called CMD commands or Command Prompt commands, the commands in Windows 98/95 and MS-DOS are called DOS commands. In this article, we have listed the most commonly used commands in the Windows operating systems. In this source you can learn cmd commands and what they do. If you have cmd commands you want to add, you can support it. üôåüèª
