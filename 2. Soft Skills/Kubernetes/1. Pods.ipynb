It represents one (or sometimes more) running container(s) in a cluster. In a simple web application, you might have one single pod: the web server. As traffic grows, you might deploy that same code to multiple pods to handle the increased load. Several pods, one codebase. In a more complex backend system, you might have several pods for the web server and several pods that handle video processing. Multiple pods, multiple codebases."
