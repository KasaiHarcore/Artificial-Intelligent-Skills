When using Docker Desktop, the Virtual Machine it runs provides an isolation boundary between containers and the host, but if running Docker Engine it is useful to use a user namespace to ensure container isolation (more info here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/userns-remap/). This page also provides a good description for why to avoid running as root: https://cloud.google.com/architecture/best-practices-for-operating-containers#avoid_running_as_root."
