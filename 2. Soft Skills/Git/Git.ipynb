    "- `git pull` — bring remote changes down (fetch + merge/rebase).\n",
    "- `git merge` — integrate another branch.\n",
    "- `git rebase` — replay commits onto a new base (rewrites history).\n",
    "- `git reset` — move `HEAD` (soft/mixed/hard).\n",
    "- `git revert` — undo a commit safely by creating a new commit.\n",
    "- `git stash` — temporarily put changes aside.\n",
    "- `git cherry-pick <commit>` — take one commit from somewhere else.\n",
    "- `git bisect` — find which commit introduced a bug (binary search).\n",
    "- `git tag` — mark a version/release.\n",
    "- `git reflog` — “life saver” log of where `HEAD` was (great for recovery)."
