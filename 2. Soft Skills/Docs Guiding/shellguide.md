## Background


<a id="s1.1-which-shell-to-use"></a>

### Which Shell to Use

Bash is the only shell scripting language permitted for executables.

Executables must start with `#!/bin/bash` and minimal flags. Use `set` to set
shell options so that calling your script as `bash script_name` does not break
its functionality.

Restricting all executable shell scripts to *bash* gives us a consistent shell
language that's installed on all our machines. In particular, this means there
is generally no need to strive for POSIX-compatibility or otherwise avoid
"bashisms".

The only exception to the above is where you're forced to by whatever you're
coding for. For example some legacy operating systems or constrained execution
environments may require plain Bourne shell for certain scripts.

<a id="s1.2-when-to-use-shell"></a>

### When to use Shell

Shell should only be used for small utilities or simple wrapper
scripts.

While shell scripting isn't a development language, it is used for
writing various utility scripts throughout Google. This style guide
is more a recognition of its use rather than a suggestion that it be
used for widespread deployment.

Some guidelines:

*   If you're mostly calling other utilities and are doing relatively
    little data manipulation, shell is an acceptable choice for the task.
*   If performance matters, use something other than shell.
*   If you are writing a script that is more than 100 lines long, or
    that uses non-straightforward control flow logic, you should
    rewrite it in a more structured language *now*. Bear in
    mind that scripts grow. Rewrite your script early to avoid a more
    time-consuming rewrite at a later date.
*   When assessing the complexity of your code (e.g. to decide whether
    to switch languages) consider whether the code is easily
    maintainable by people other than its author.


<a id="s2-shell-files-and-interpreter-invocation"></a>

## Shell Files and Interpreter Invocation

<a id="s2.1-file-extensions"></a>

### File Extensions

Executables should have no extension (strongly preferred) or a
`.sh` extension. Libraries must have a `.sh`
extension and should not be executable.

It is not necessary to know what language a program is written in when
executing it and shell doesn't require an extension so we prefer not
to use one for executables.

However, for libraries it's important to know what language it is and
sometimes there's a need to have similar libraries in different
languages. This allows library files with identical purposes but
different languages to be identically named except for the
language-specific suffix.

<a id="s2.2-suid-sgid"></a>

### SUID/SGID

SUID and SGID are *forbidden* on shell scripts.

There are too many security issues with shell that make it nearly
impossible to secure sufficiently to allow SUID/SGID. While bash does
make it difficult to run SUID, it's still possible on some platforms
which is why we're being explicit about banning it.

Use `sudo` to provide elevated access if you need it.

<a id="s3-environment"></a>

## Environment

<a id="s3.1-stdout-vs-stderr"></a>

### STDOUT vs STDERR

All error messages should go to `STDERR`.

This makes it easier to separate normal status from actual issues.

A function to print out error messages along with other status
information is recommended.

```shell
err() {
  echo "[$(date +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z')]: $*" >&2
}

if ! do_something; then
  err "Unable to do_something"
  exit 1
fi
```

<a id="s4-comments"></a>

## Comments

<a id="s4.1-file-header"></a>

### File Header

Start each file with a description of its contents.

Every file must have a top-level comment including a brief overview of
its contents. A
copyright notice
and author information are optional.

Example:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
#
# Perform hot backups of Oracle databases.
```

<a id="s4.2-function-comments"></a>

### Function Comments

Any function that is not both obvious and short must have a function header
comment. Any function in a library must have a function header comment
regardless of length or complexity.

It should be possible for someone else to learn how to use your
program or to use a function in your library by reading the comments
(and self-help, if provided) without reading the code.

All function header comments should describe the intended API behaviour using:

*   Description of the function.
*   Globals: List of global variables used and modified.
*   Arguments: Arguments taken.
*   Outputs: Output to STDOUT or STDERR.
*   Returns: Returned values other than the default exit status of the
    last command run.

Example:

```shell
#######################################
# Cleanup files from the backup directory.
# Globals:
#   BACKUP_DIR
#   ORACLE_SID
# Arguments:
#   None
#######################################
function cleanup() {
  …
}

#######################################
# Get configuration directory.
# Globals:
#   SOMEDIR
# Arguments:
#   None
# Outputs:
#   Writes location to stdout
#######################################
function get_dir() {
  echo "${SOMEDIR}"
}

#######################################
# Delete a file in a sophisticated manner.
# Arguments:
#   File to delete, a path.
# Returns:
#   0 if thing was deleted, non-zero on error.
#######################################
function del_thing() {
  rm "$1"
}
```

<a id="s4.3-implementation-comments"></a>

### Implementation Comments

Comment tricky, non-obvious, interesting or important parts of your
code.

This follows general Google coding comment practice. Don't comment
everything. If there's a complex algorithm or you're doing something
out of the ordinary, put a short comment in.

<a id="s4.4-todo-comments"></a>

### TODO Comments

Use TODO comments for code that is temporary, a short-term solution, or
good-enough but not perfect.

This matches the convention in the [C++ Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#TODO_Comments).


`TODO`s should include the string `TODO` in all caps, followed by the name,
e-mail address, or other identifier of the person with the best context about
the problem referenced by the `TODO`. The main purpose is to have a consistent
`TODO` that can be searched to find out how to get more details upon request. A
`TODO` is not a commitment that the person referenced will fix the problem. Thus
when you create a `TODO`, it is almost always your name that is given.

Examples:

```shell
# TODO(mrmonkey): Handle the unlikely edge cases (bug ####)
```

<a id="s5-formatting"></a>

## Formatting

While you should follow the style that's already there for files that
you're modifying, the following are required for any new code.

<a id="s5.1-indentation"></a>

### Indentation

Indent 2 spaces. No tabs.

Use blank lines between blocks to improve readability. Indentation is
two spaces. Whatever you do, don't use tabs. For existing files, stay
faithful to the existing indentation.

**Exception:** The only exception for using tabs is for the body of `<<-`
tab-indented
[here-document](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Redirections.html#Here-Documents).

<a id="s5.2-line-length-and-long-strings"></a>

### Line Length and Long Strings

Maximum line length is 80 characters.

If you have to write literal strings that are longer than 80 characters, this
should be done with a
[here document](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Redirections.html#Here-Documents)
or an embedded newline if possible.

Words that are longer than 80 chars and can't sensibly be split are ok, but
where possible these items should be on a line of their own, or factored into a
variable. Examples include file paths and URLs, particularly where
string-matching them (such as `grep`) is valuable for maintenance.

```shell
# DO use 'here document's
cat <<END
I am an exceptionally long
string.
END

# Embedded newlines are ok too
long_string="I am an exceptionally
long string."

long_file="/i/am/an/exceptionally/loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong_file"

long_string_with_long_file="i am including an exceptionally \
/very/long/file\
 in this long string."

# Long file converted into a shorter variable name with cleaner line breaking.
long_string_alt="i am an including an exceptionally ${long_file} in this long\
 string"
```

```shell
# Just because a line contains an exception doesn't mean the rest of the
# line shouldn't be wrapped like usual.

bad_long_string_with_long_file="i am including an exceptionally /very/long/file in this long string."
```

<a id="s5.3-pipelines"></a>

### Pipelines

Pipelines should be split one per line if they don't all fit on one line.

If a pipeline all fits on one line, it should be on one line.

If not, it should be split at one pipe segment per line with the pipe on the
newline and a 2 space indent for the next section of the pipe. `\ ` should be
consistently used to indicate line continuation. This applies to a chain of
commands combined using `|` as well as to logical compounds using `||` and `&&`.

```shell
# All fits on one line
command1 | command2

# Long commands
command1 \
  | command2 \
  | command3 \
  | command4
```

This helps readability when distinguishing a pipeline from a regular long
command continuation, particularly if the line is using both.

Comments will need to precede the whole pipeline. If the comment and pipeline
are large and complex, then it is worth considering moving low level details of
them aside by using a helper function.

<a id="s5.4-control-flow"></a>

<!-- section was previously titled "Loops" -->

<a id="s5.4-loops"></a>
<a id="loops"></a>

### Control Flow

Put `; then` and `; do` on the same line as the `if`, `for`, or `while`.

Control flow statements in shell are a bit different, but we follow the same
principles as with braces when declaring functions. That is: `; then` and `; do`
should be on the same line as the `if`/`for`/`while`/`until`/`select`. `else`
should be on its own line and closing statements (`fi` and `done`) should be on
their own line vertically aligned with the opening statement.

Example:

```shell
# If inside a function remember to declare the loop variable as
# a local to avoid it leaking into the global environment:
local dir
for dir in "${dirs_to_cleanup[@]}"; do
  if [[ -d "${dir}/${SESSION_ID}" ]]; then
    log_date "Cleaning up old files in ${dir}/${SESSION_ID}"
    rm "${dir}/${SESSION_ID}/"* || error_message
  else
    mkdir -p "${dir}/${SESSION_ID}" || error_message
  fi
done
```

Although it is possible to
[omit `in "$@"`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Looping-Constructs.html#index-for)
in for loops we recommend consistently including it for clarity.

```shell
for arg in "$@"; do
  echo "argument: ${arg}"
done
```

<a id="s5.5-case-statement"></a>

### Case statement

*   Indent alternatives by 2 spaces.
*   A one-line alternative needs a space after the close parenthesis of
    the pattern and before the `;;`.
*   Long or multi-command alternatives should be split over multiple
    lines with the pattern, actions, and `;;` on separate
    lines.

The matching expressions are indented one level from the `case` and `esac`.
Multiline actions are indented another level. In general, there is no need to
quote match expressions. Pattern expressions should not be preceded by an open
parenthesis. Avoid the `;&` and `;;&` notations.

```shell
case "${expression}" in
  a)
    variable="…"
    some_command "${variable}" "${other_expr}" …
    ;;
  absolute)
    actions="relative"
    another_command "${actions}" "${other_expr}" …
    ;;
  *)
    error "Unexpected expression '${expression}'"
    ;;
esac
```

Simple commands may be put on the same line as the pattern <i>and</i>
`;;` as long as the expression remains readable. This is
often appropriate for single-letter option processing. When the
actions don't fit on a single line, put the pattern on a line on its
own, then the actions, then `;;` also on a line of its own.
When on the same line as the actions, use a space after the close
parenthesis of the pattern and another before the `;;`.

```shell
verbose='false'
aflag=''
bflag=''
files=''
while getopts 'abf:v' flag; do
  case "${flag}" in
    a) aflag='true' ;;
    b) bflag='true' ;;
    f) files="${OPTARG}" ;;
    v) verbose='true' ;;
    *) error "Unexpected option ${flag}" ;;
  esac
done
```

<a id="s5.6-variable-expansion"></a>

### Variable expansion

In order of precedence: Stay consistent with what you find; quote your
variables; prefer `"${var}"` over `"$var"`.

These are strongly recommended guidelines but not mandatory
regulation. Nonetheless, the fact that it's a recommendation and
not mandatory doesn't mean it should be taken lightly or downplayed.

They are listed in order of precedence.

*   Stay consistent with what you find for existing code.
*   Quote variables, see [Quoting section below](#quoting).
*   Don't brace-delimit single character shell specials / positional parameters,
    unless strictly necessary or avoiding deep confusion.

    Prefer brace-delimiting all other variables.

    ```shell
    # Section of *recommended* cases.

    # Preferred style for 'special' variables:
    echo "Positional: $1" "$5" "$3"
    echo "Specials: !=$!, -=$-, _=$_. ?=$?, #=$# *=$* @=$@ \$=$$ …"

    # Braces necessary:
    echo "many parameters: ${10}"

    # Braces avoiding confusion:
    # Output is "a0b0c0"
    set -- a b c
    echo "${1}0${2}0${3}0"

    # Preferred style for other variables:
    echo "PATH=${PATH}, PWD=${PWD}, mine=${some_var}"
    while read -r f; do
      echo "file=${f}"
    done < <(find /tmp)
    ```

    ```shell
    # Section of *discouraged* cases

    # Unquoted vars, unbraced vars, brace-delimited single letter
    # shell specials.
    echo a=$avar "b=$bvar" "PID=${$}" "${1}"

    # Confusing use: this is expanded as "${1}0${2}0${3}0",
    # not "${10}${20}${30}
    set -- a b c
    echo "$10$20$30"
    ```

NOTE: Using braces in `${var}` is *not* a form of quoting. "Double quotes" must
be used *as well*.

<a id="s5.7-quoting"></a>

### Quoting

*   Always quote strings containing variables, command substitutions, spaces or
    shell meta characters, unless careful unquoted expansion is required or it's
    a shell-internal integer (see next point).
*   Use arrays for safe quoting of lists of elements, especially command-line
    flags. See [Arrays](#arrays) below.
*   Optionally quote shell-internal, readonly
    [special variables](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Special-Parameters.html)
    that are defined to be integers: `$?`, `$#`, `$$`, `$!`. Prefer quoting of
    "named" internal integer variables, e.g. PPID etc for consistency.
*   Prefer quoting strings that are "words" (as opposed to command options or
    path names).
*   Be aware of the quoting rules for pattern matches in `[[ … ]]`. See the
    [Test, `[ … ]`, and `[[ … ]]`](#tests) section below.
*   Use `"$@"` unless you have a specific reason to use `$*`, such as simply
    appending the arguments to a string in a message or log.

```shell
# 'Single' quotes indicate that no substitution is desired.
# "Double" quotes indicate that substitution is required/tolerated.

# Simple examples

# "quote command substitutions"
# Note that quotes nested inside "$()" don't need escaping.
flag="$(some_command and its args "$@" 'quoted separately')"

# "quote variables"
echo "${flag}"

# Use arrays with quoted expansion for lists.
declare -a FLAGS
FLAGS=( --foo --bar='baz' )
readonly FLAGS
mybinary "${FLAGS[@]}"

# It's ok to not quote internal integer variables.
if (( $# > 3 )); then
  echo "ppid=${PPID}"
fi

# "never quote literal integers"
value=32
# "quote command substitutions", even when you expect integers
number="$(generate_number)"

# "prefer quoting words", not compulsory
readonly USE_INTEGER='true'

# "quote shell meta characters"
echo 'Hello stranger, and well met. Earn lots of $$$'
echo "Process $$: Done making \$\$\$."

# "command options or path names"
# ($1 is assumed to contain a value here)
grep -li Hugo /dev/null "$1"

# Less simple examples
# "quote variables, unless proven false": ccs might be empty
git send-email --to "${reviewers}" ${ccs:+"--cc" "${ccs}"}

# Positional parameter precautions: $1 might be unset
# Single quotes leave regex as-is.
grep -cP '([Ss]pecial|\|?characters*)$' ${1:+"$1"}

# For passing on arguments,
# "$@" is right almost every time, and
# $* is wrong almost every time:
#
# * $* and $@ will split on spaces, clobbering up arguments
#   that contain spaces and dropping empty strings;
# * "$@" will retain arguments as-is, so no args
#   provided will result in no args being passed on;
#   This is in most cases what you want to use for passing
#   on arguments.
# * "$*" expands to one argument, with all args joined
#   by (usually) spaces,
#   so no args provided will result in one empty string
#   being passed on.
#

## Features and Bugs

<a id="s6.1-shellcheck"></a>

### ShellCheck

The [ShellCheck project](https://www.shellcheck.net/) identifies common bugs and
warnings for your shell scripts. It is recommended for all scripts, large or
small.

<a id="s6.2-command-substitution"></a>

### Command Substitution

Use `$(command)` instead of backticks.

Nested backticks require escaping the inner ones with `\ `.
The `$(command)` format doesn't change when nested and is
easier to read.

Example:

```shell
# This is preferred:
var="$(command "$(command1)")"
```

```shell
# This is not:
var="`command \`command1\``"
```

<a id="s6.3-tests"></a>

<a id="tests"></a>
### Test, `[ … ]`, and `[[ … ]]` 

`[[ … ]]` is preferred over `[ … ]`, `test` and `/usr/bin/[`.

`[[ … ]]` reduces errors as no pathname expansion or word splitting takes place
between `[[` and `]]`. In addition, `[[ … ]]` allows for pattern and regular
expression matching, while `[ … ]` does not.

```shell
# This ensures the string on the left is made up of characters in
# the alnum character class followed by the string name.
# Note that the RHS should not be quoted here.
if [[ "filename" =~ ^[[:alnum:]]+name ]]; then
  echo "Match"
fi

# This matches the exact pattern "f*" (Does not match in this case)
if [[ "filename" == "f*" ]]; then
  echo "Match"
fi
```

```shell
# This gives a "too many arguments" error as f* is expanded to the
# contents of the current directory. It might also trigger the
# "unexpected operator" error because `[` does not support `==`, only `=`.
if [ "filename" == f* ]; then
  echo "Match"
fi
```

For the gory details, see E14 in the [Bash FAQ](http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/FAQ)

<a id="s6.4-testing-strings"></a>

### Testing Strings

Use quotes rather than filler characters where possible.

Bash is smart enough to deal with an empty string in a test. So, given
that the code is much easier to read, use tests for empty/non-empty
strings or empty strings rather than filler characters.

```shell
# Do this:
if [[ "${my_var}" == "some_string" ]]; then
  do_something
fi

# -z (string length is zero) and -n (string length is not zero) are
# preferred over testing for an empty string
if [[ -z "${my_var}" ]]; then
  do_something
fi

# This is OK (ensure quotes on the empty side), but not preferred:
if [[ "${my_var}" == "" ]]; then
  do_something
fi
```

```shell
# Not this:
if [[ "${my_var}X" == "some_stringX" ]]; then
  do_something
fi
```

To avoid confusion about what you're testing for, explicitly use
`-z` or `-n`.

```shell
# Use this
if [[ -n "${my_var}" ]]; then
  do_something
fi
```

```shell
# Instead of this
if [[ "${my_var}" ]]; then
  do_something
fi
```

For clarity, use `==` for equality rather than
`=` even though both work. The former encourages the use of
`[[` and the latter can be confused with an assignment.
However, be careful when using `<` and `>`
in `[[ … ]]` which performs a lexicographical comparison.
Use `(( … ))` or `-lt` and `-gt` for
numerical comparison.

```shell
# Use this
if [[ "${my_var}" == "val" ]]; then
  do_something
fi

if (( my_var > 3 )); then
  do_something
fi

if [[ "${my_var}" -gt 3 ]]; then
  do_something
fi
```

```shell
# Instead of this
if [[ "${my_var}" = "val" ]]; then
  do_something
fi

# Probably unintended lexicographical comparison.
if [[ "${my_var}" > 3 ]]; then
  # True for 4, false for 22.
  do_something
fi
```

<a id="s6.5-wildcard-expansion-of-filenames"></a>

### Wildcard Expansion of Filenames

Use an explicit path when doing wildcard expansion of filenames.

As filenames can begin with a `-`, it's a lot safer to
expand wildcards with `./*` instead of `*`.

```shell
# Here's the contents of the directory:
# -f  -r  somedir  somefile

# Incorrectly deletes almost everything in the directory by force
psa@bilby$ rm -v *
removed directory: `somedir'
removed `somefile'
```

```shell
# As opposed to:
psa@bilby$ rm -v ./*
removed `./-f'
removed `./-r'
rm: cannot remove `./somedir': Is a directory
removed `./somefile'
```

<a id="s6.6-eval"></a>

### Eval

`eval` should be avoided.


Eval munges the input when used for assignment to variables and can
set variables without making it possible to check what those variables
were.

```shell
# What does this set?
# Did it succeed? In part or whole?
eval $(set_my_variables)

# What happens if one of the returned values has a space in it?
variable="$(eval some_function)"
```

<a id="s6.7-arrays"></a>

### Arrays

Bash arrays should be used to store lists of elements, to avoid quoting
complications. This particularly applies to argument lists. Arrays
should not be used to facilitate more complex data structures (see
[When to use Shell](#when-to-use-shell) above).

Arrays store an ordered collection of strings, and can be safely
expanded into individual elements for a command or loop.

Using a single string for multiple command arguments should be
avoided, as it inevitably leads to authors using `eval`
or trying to nest quotes inside the string, which does not give
reliable or readable results and leads to needless complexity.

```shell
# An array is assigned using parentheses, and can be appended to
# with +=( … ).
declare -a flags
flags=(--foo --bar='baz')
flags+=(--greeting="Hello ${name}")
mybinary "${flags[@]}"
```

```shell
# Don’t use strings for sequences.
flags='--foo --bar=baz'
flags+=' --greeting="Hello world"'  # This won’t work as intended.
mybinary ${flags}
```

```shell
# Command expansions return single strings, not arrays. Avoid
# unquoted expansion in array assignments because it won’t
# work correctly if the command output contains special
# characters or whitespace.

# This expands the listing output into a string, then does special keyword
# expansion, and then whitespace splitting.  Only then is it turned into a
# list of words.  The ls command may also change behavior based on the user's
# active environment!
declare -a files=($(ls /directory))

# The get_arguments writes everything to STDOUT, but then goes through the
# same expansion process above before turning into a list of arguments.
mybinary $(get_arguments)
```

<a id="s6.7.1-arrays-pros"></a>

#### Arrays Pros

*   Using Arrays allows lists of things without confusing quoting
    semantics. Conversely, not using arrays leads to misguided
    attempts to nest quoting inside a string.
*   Arrays make it possible to safely store sequences/lists of
    arbitrary strings, including strings containing whitespace.

<a id="s6.7.2-arrays-cons"></a>

#### Arrays Cons

Using arrays can risk a script’s complexity growing.

<a id="s6.7.3-arrays-decision"></a>

#### Arrays Decision

Arrays should be used to safely create and pass around lists. In
particular, when building a set of command arguments, use arrays to
avoid confusing quoting issues. Use quoted expansion –
`"${array[@]}"` – to access arrays. However, if more
advanced data manipulation is required, shell scripting should be
avoided altogether; see [above](#when-to-use-shell).

<a id="s6.8-pipes-to-while"></a>

### Pipes to While

Use process substitution or the `readarray` builtin (bash4+) in preference to
piping to `while`. Pipes create a subshell, so any variables modified within a
pipeline do not propagate to the parent shell.

The implicit subshell in a pipe to `while` can introduce subtle bugs that are
hard to track down.

```shell
last_line='NULL'
your_command | while read -r line; do
  if [[ -n "${line}" ]]; then
    last_line="${line}"
  fi
done

# This will always output 'NULL'!
echo "${last_line}"
```

Using process substitution also creates a subshell. However, it allows
redirecting from a subshell to a `while` without putting the `while` (or any
other command) in a subshell.

```shell
last_line='NULL'
while read line; do
  if [[ -n "${line}" ]]; then
    last_line="${line}"
  fi
done < <(your_command)

# This will output the last non-empty line from your_command
echo "${last_line}"
```

Alternatively, use the `readarray` builtin to read the file into an array, then
loop over the array's contents. Notice that (for the same reason as above) you
need to use a process substitution with `readarray` rather than a pipe, but with
the advantage that the input generation for the loop is located before it,
rather than after.

```shell
last_line='NULL'
readarray -t lines < <(your_command)
for line in "${lines[@]}"; do
  if [[ -n "${line}" ]]; then
    last_line="${line}"
  fi
done
echo "${last_line}"
```

> Note: Be cautious using a for-loop to iterate over output, as in `for var in
> $(...)`, as the output is split by whitespace, not by line. Sometimes you will
> know this is safe because the output can't contain any unexpected whitespace,
> but where this isn't obvious or doesn't improve readability (such as a long
> command inside `$(...)`), a `while read` loop or `readarray` is often safer
> and clearer.

<a id="s6.9-arithmetic"></a>

### Arithmetic

Always use `(( … ))` or `$(( … ))` rather than
`let` or `$[ … ]` or `expr`.

Never use the `$[ … ]` syntax, the `expr`
command, or the `let` built-in.

`<` and `>` don't perform numerical
comparison inside `[[ … ]]` expressions (they perform
lexicographical comparisons instead; see [Testing Strings](#testing-strings)).
For preference, don't use `[[ … ]]` *at all* for numeric comparisons, use
`(( … ))` instead.

It is recommended to avoid using `(( … ))` as a standalone
statement, and otherwise be wary of its expression evaluating to zero
- particularly with `set -e` enabled. For example,
`set -e; i=0; (( i++ ))` will cause the shell to exit.

```shell
# Simple calculation used as text - note the use of $(( … )) within
# a string.
echo "$(( 2 + 2 )) is 4"

# When performing arithmetic comparisons for testing
if (( a < b )); then
  …
fi

# Some calculation assigned to a variable.
(( i = 10 * j + 400 ))
```

```shell
# This form is non-portable and deprecated
i=$[2 * 10]

# Despite appearances, 'let' isn't one of the declarative keywords,
# so unquoted assignments are subject to globbing wordsplitting.
# For the sake of simplicity, avoid 'let' and use (( … ))
let i="2 + 2"

# The expr utility is an external program and not a shell builtin.
i=$( expr 4 + 4 )

# Quoting can be error prone when using expr too.
i=$( expr 4 '*' 4 )
```

Stylistic considerations aside, the shell's built-in arithmetic is
many times faster than `expr`.

When using variables, the `${var}` (and `$var`)
forms are not required within `$(( … ))`. The shell knows
to look up `var` for you, and omitting the
`${…}` leads to cleaner code. This is slightly contrary to
the previous rule about always using braces, so this is a
recommendation only.

```shell
# N.B.: Remember to declare your variables as integers when
# possible, and to prefer local variables over globals.
local -i hundred="$(( 10 * 10 ))"
declare -i five="$(( 10 / 2 ))"

# Increment the variable "i" by three.
# Note that:
#  - We do not write ${i} or $i.
#  - We put a space after the (( and before the )).
(( i += 3 ))

# To decrement the variable "i" by five:
(( i -= 5 ))

# Do some complicated computations.
# Note that normal arithmetic operator precedence is observed.
hr=2
min=5
sec=30
echo "$(( hr * 3600 + min * 60 + sec ))" # prints 7530 as expected
```

<a id="s6.10-aliases"></a>

## Aliases

Although commonly seen in `.bashrc` files, aliases should be avoided in scripts.
As the
[Bash manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Aliases.html)
notes:

> For almost every purpose, shell functions are preferred over aliases.

Aliases are cumbersome to work with because they require carefully quoting and
escaping their contents, and mistakes can be hard to notice.

```shell
# this evaluates $RANDOM once when the alias is defined,
# so the echo'ed string will be the same on each invocation
alias random_name="echo some_prefix_${RANDOM}"
```

Functions provide a superset of alias' functionality and should always be
preferred. .

```shell
random_name() {
  echo "some_prefix_${RANDOM}"
}

# Note that unlike aliases function's arguments are accessed via $@
fancy_ls() {
  ls -lh "$@"
}
```

<a id="s7-naming-conventions"></a>

## Naming Conventions

<a id="s7.1-function-names"></a>

### Function Names

Lower-case, with underscores to separate words. Separate libraries with `::`.
Parentheses are required after the function name. The keyword `function` is
optional, but must be used consistently throughout a project.

If you're writing single functions, use lowercase and separate words with
underscore. If you're writing a package, separate package names with `::`.
However, functions intended for interactive use may choose to avoid colons as it
can confuse bash auto-completion.

Braces must be on the same line as the function name (as with other languages at
Google) and no space between the function name and the parenthesis.

```shell
# Single function
my_func() {
  …
}

# Part of a package
mypackage::my_func() {
  …
}
```

The `function` keyword is extraneous when "()" is present
after the function name, but enhances quick identification of
functions.

<a id="s7.2-variable-names"></a>

### Variable Names

Same as for function names.

Variables names for loops should be similarly named for any variable
you're looping through.

```shell
for zone in "${zones[@]}"; do
  something_with "${zone}"
done
```

<a id="s7.3-constants-and-environment-variable-names"></a>
<a id="s7.5-read-only-variables"></a>

### Constants, Environment Variables, and readonly Variables

Constants and anything exported to the environment should be capitalized,
separated with underscores, and declared at the top of the file.

```shell
# Constant
readonly PATH_TO_FILES='/some/path'

# Both constant and exported to the environment
declare -xr ORACLE_SID='PROD'
```

For the sake of clarity `readonly` or `export` is recommended vs. the equivalent
`declare` commands. You can do one after the other, like:

```shell
# Constant
readonly PATH_TO_FILES='/some/path'
export PATH_TO_FILES
```

It's OK to set a constant at runtime or in a conditional, but it should be made
readonly immediately afterwards.

```shell
ZIP_VERSION="$(dpkg --status zip | sed -n 's/^Version: //p')"
if [[ -z "${ZIP_VERSION}" ]]; then
  ZIP_VERSION="$(pacman -Q --info zip | sed -n 's/^Version *: //p')"
fi
if [[ -z "${ZIP_VERSION}" ]]; then
  handle_error_and_quit
fi
readonly ZIP_VERSION
```

<a id="s7.4-source-filenames"></a>

### Source Filenames

Lowercase, with underscores to separate words if desired.

This is for consistency with other code styles in Google:
`maketemplate` or `make_template` but not
`make-template`.

<a id="s7.5-use-local-variables"></a>
<a id="s7.6-use-local-variables"></a>

### Use Local Variables

Declare function-specific variables with `local`.

Ensure that local variables are only seen inside a function and its children by
using `local` when declaring them. This avoids polluting the global namespace
and inadvertently setting variables that may have significance outside the
function.

Declaration and assignment must be separate statements when the
assignment value is provided by a command substitution; as the
`local` builtin does not propagate the exit code from the
command substitution.

```shell
my_func2() {
  local name="$1"

  # Separate lines for declaration and assignment:
  local my_var
  my_var="$(my_func)"
  (( $? == 0 )) || return

  …
}
```

```shell
my_func2() {
  # DO NOT do this:
  # $? will always be zero, as it contains the exit code of 'local', not my_func
  local my_var="$(my_func)"
  (( $? == 0 )) || return

  …
}
```

<a id="s7.6-function-location"></a>
<a id="s7.7-function-location"></a>

### Function Location

Put all functions together in the file just below constants. Don't hide
executable code between functions. Doing so makes the code difficult to follow
and results in nasty surprises when debugging.

If you've got functions, put them all together near the top of the
file. Only includes, `set` statements and setting constants
may be done before declaring functions.

<a id="s7.7-main"></a>
<a id="s7.8-main"></a>

### main

A function called `main` is required for scripts long enough
to contain at least one other function.

In order to easily find the start of the program, put the main program in a
function called `main` as the bottom-most function. This provides consistency
with the rest of the code base as well as allowing you to define more variables
as `local` (which can't be done if the main code is not a function). The last
non-comment line in the file should be a call to `main`:

```shell
main "$@"
```

Obviously, for short scripts where it's just a linear flow,
`main` is overkill and so is not required.

<a id="s8-calling-commands"></a>

## Calling Commands

<a id="s8.1-checking-return-values"></a>

### Checking Return Values

Always check return values and give informative return values.

For unpiped commands, use `$?` or check directly via an
`if` statement to keep it simple.

Example:

```shell
if ! mv "${file_list[@]}" "${dest_dir}/"; then
  echo "Unable to move ${file_list[*]} to ${dest_dir}" >&2
  exit 1
fi

# Or
mv "${file_list[@]}" "${dest_dir}/"
if (( $? != 0 )); then
  echo "Unable to move ${file_list[*]} to ${dest_dir}" >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

Bash also has the `PIPESTATUS` variable that allows
checking of the return code from all parts of a pipe. If it's only
necessary to check success or failure of the whole pipe, then the
following is acceptable:

```shell
tar -cf - ./* | ( cd "${dir}" && tar -xf - )
if (( PIPESTATUS[0] != 0 || PIPESTATUS[1] != 0 )); then
  echo "Unable to tar files to ${dir}" >&2
fi
```

However, as `PIPESTATUS` will be overwritten as soon as you
do any other command, if you need to act differently on errors based
on where it happened in the pipe, you'll need to assign
`PIPESTATUS` to another variable immediately after running
the command (don't forget that `[` is a command and will
wipe out `PIPESTATUS`).

```shell
tar -cf - ./* | ( cd "${DIR}" && tar -xf - )
return_codes=( "${PIPESTATUS[@]}" )
if (( return_codes[0] != 0 )); then
  do_something
fi
if (( return_codes[1] != 0 )); then
  do_something_else
fi
```

<a id="s8.2-builtin-commands-vs-external-commands"></a>

### Builtin Commands vs. External Commands

Given the choice between invoking a shell builtin and invoking a
separate process, choose the builtin.

We prefer the use of builtins such as the
[*Parameter Expansion*](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html)
functionality provided by `bash` as it's more efficient, robust, and portable
(especially when compared to things like `sed`). See also the
[`=~` operator](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Conditional-Constructs.html#index-_005b_005b).

Examples:

```shell
# Prefer this:
addition="$(( X + Y ))"
substitution="${string/#foo/bar}"
if [[ "${string}" =~ foo:(\d+) ]]; then
  extraction="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"
fi
```

```shell
# Instead of this:
addition="$(expr "${X}" + "${Y}")"
substitution="$(echo "${string}" | sed -e 's/^foo/bar/')"
extraction="$(echo "${string}" | sed -e 's/foo:\([0-9]\)/\1/')"
```

<a id="s9-conclusion"></a>

## When in Doubt: Be Consistent

Using one style consistently through our codebase lets us focus on other (more
important) issues. Consistency also allows for automation. In many cases, rules
that are attributed to “Be Consistent” boil down to “Just pick one and stop
worrying about it”; the potential value of allowing flexibility on these points
is outweighed by the cost of having people argue over them.

However, there are limits to consistency. It is a good tie breaker when there is
no clear technical argument, nor a long-term direction. Consistency should not
generally be used as a justification to do things in an old style without
considering the benefits of the new style, or the tendency of the codebase to
converge on newer styles over time.
