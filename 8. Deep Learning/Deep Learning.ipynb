    "# Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theory:** Neural Networks are a class of machine learning models inspired by biological neural networks. They are composed of multiple layers of interconnected neurons, which process and transmit information using electrical and chemical signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works:**\n",
    "- Each neuron receives input signals from the previous layer and computes an output signal using an activation function.\n",
    "- The output signal is then passed on to the next layer, which performs the same computation until the output layer is reached.\n",
    "- The output layer produces the final output signal, which is used to make a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support Functions:** Neural Networks rely on the calculation of outputs from each neuron and the backpropagation of errors to update the model parameters (weights).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Can learn non-linear relationships in data.\n",
    "- Can be used for both classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "- Can be used for both supervised and unsupervised learning.\n",
    "- Can be used for both structured and unstructured data.\n",
    "- Can be used for both numerical and categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Computationally expensive, especially with large datasets.\n",
    "- Requires a large amount of training data.\n",
    "- Requires careful preprocessing of data.\n",
    "- Prone to overfitting.\n",
    "- Difficult to interpret and explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "- Activation Function: The activation function of a neuron defines the output of that neuron given a set of inputs. It introduces non-linearity to the model, which allows it to learn non-linear relationships in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a = f(z) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $a$ is the output of the neuron.\n",
    "- $z$ is the weighted sum of inputs to the neuron.\n",
    "- $f$ is the activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loss Function: The loss function of a neural network defines the difference between the predicted and actual values. It is used to measure the model's performance and guide the optimization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use:**\n",
    "- Use Neural Networks when you want to learn non-linear relationships in your data and have a large amount of training data.\n",
    "- They are commonly used in image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition."

    "\n",
    "Backpropagation is a fundamental concept in neural network training. It's a key part of the training process that allows neural networks to update their weights and biases in order to minimize the error (or loss) between the predicted output and the actual target values. I'll explain the theory behind backpropagation and provide code examples for implementing it in TensorFlow and PyTorch.\n",

    "**Theory:** Backpropagation, short for \"backward propagation of errors,\" is a supervised learning algorithm used to train neural networks.

    "3. Backward Pass (Backpropagation): In the backward pass, the algorithm calculates the gradients of the loss function with respect to the network's weights and biases. This is done by applying the chain rule to compute the gradients layer by layer, starting from the output layer and moving backward through the network.\n",
    "\n",

In cases where knowledge is lacking, a multi-layer perceptron is often the best solution. However, these unstructured networks may become too crowded when processing multidimensional cognitive data. For example, a high-quality labeled image set with a 1 million-pixel resolution would require a dense layer of 109 parameters, making learning the parameters impossible.\n",

Learning a binary classifier with a lot of parameters would likely require a huge set of data, equivalent to the number of dogs and cats on Earth.

Generally speaking, assuming the size of the input is $nh * nw$, and the dimension of the accumulated kernel window is $kh * kw$, the output size will be:\n",

    "    - In some cases, we're going to combine other techniques that also affect the size of the output, such as adding buffers and accumulating spacing. Note that since the nuclei are generally larger than 1 in width and height, after applying multiple consecutive accumulations, the output is generally significantly smaller than the input. If we start with a picture of 240×240 pixels and apply 10 layers of 5×5 accumulation, then the image size will be reduced to 200×200 pixels, 30% of the image will be cut off, and all useful information on the border of the original picture will be deleted. Padding is the most common tool for dealing with this problem.\n",

Gradually aggregating information yields coarser maps, achieving a global representation while maintaining convolutional layers' advantages at intermediate layers. Reducing spatial resolution accelerates this process. Representations should be invariant to translation, as objects rarely occur exactly at the same place. Pooling layers mitigate the sensitivity of convolutional layers to location and spatially downsample representations, ensuring accurate detection of lower-level features like edges.\n",
    "    **Max pooling**\n",
    "    - Like convolutional layers, pooling operators consist of a fixed-shape window that is slid over all regions in the input according to its stride, computing a single output for each location traversed by the fixed-shape window (sometimes known as the pooling window). However, unlike the cross-correlation computation of the inputs and kernels in the convolutional layer, the pooling layer contains no parameters (there is no kernel). Instead, pooling operators are deterministic, typically calculating either the maximum or the average value of the elements in the pooling window. These operations are called maximum pooling (max-pooling for short) and average pooling, respectively.\n",
