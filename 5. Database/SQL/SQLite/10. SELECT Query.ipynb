    "\n",
    "The basic syntax of the SELECT statement is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT column1, column2, columnN FROM table_name;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, column1, column2 ... are the fields of a table, whose values you want to fetch. If you want to fetch all the fields available in the field, then you can use the following syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM table_name;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
