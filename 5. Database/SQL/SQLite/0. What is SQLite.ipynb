    "SQLite is a software library that provides a relational database management system. The lite in SQLite means lightweight in terms of setup, database administration, and required resources.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Serverless\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, an RDBMS such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc., requires a separate server process to operate. The applications that want to access the database server use TCP/IP protocol to send and receive requests. This is called client/server architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "But:\n",
    "- SQLite does NOT require a server to run.\n",
    "- SQLite database is directly handled by the application that accesses the database.\n",

    "## Self-contained\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is self-contained means it requires minimal support from the operating system or external library. This makes SQLite usable in any environment especially in embedded devices like iPhones, Android phones, game consoles, handheld media players, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is developed using ANSI-C. The source code is available as a big sqlite3.c and its header file sqlite3.h. If you want to develop an application that uses SQLite, you just need to drop these files into your project and compile it with your code."

    "### Zero-configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the serverless architecture, you don’t need to “install” SQLite before using it. There is no server process that needs to be configured, started, and stopped.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, SQLite does not use any configuration files."
