    "# The AND Operator\n",
    "\n",
    "The AND operator allows the existence of multiple conditions in a SQLite statement's WHERE clause. While using AND operator, complete condition will be assumed true when all the conditions are true. For example, [condition1] AND [condition2] will be true only when both condition1 and condition2 are true.\n",

    "## Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Following is the basic syntax of AND operator with WHERE clause.\n",
