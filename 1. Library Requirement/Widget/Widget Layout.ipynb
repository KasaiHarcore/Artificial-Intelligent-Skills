        "The `Box` widget enables the entire CSS flexbox spec, enabling rich reactive layouts in the Jupyter notebook. It aims at providing an efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container.\n",
        "\n",
        "Again, the whole grid layout spec is exposed via the `layout` attribute of the container widget (`Box`) and the contained items. One may share the same `layout` attribute among all the contained items.\n",
        "\n",
        "The following flexbox tutorial on the flexbox layout follows the lines of the article [A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) by Chris House, and uses text and various images from the article [with permission](https://css-tricks.com/license/).\n",

        "To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with display: grid, set the column and row sizes with grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns, and grid_template_areas, and then place its child elements into the grid with grid-column and grid-row. Similarly to flexbox, the source order of the grid items doesn't matter. Your CSS can place them in any order, which makes it super easy to rearrange your grid with media queries. Imagine defining the layout of your entire page, and then completely rearranging it to accommodate a different screen width all with only a couple lines of CSS. Grid is one of the most powerful CSS modules ever introduced.\n",
        "\n",
        "As of March 2017, most browsers shipped native, unprefixed support for CSS Grid: Chrome (including on Android), Firefox, Safari (including on iOS), and Opera.

The `Image` widget has attributes `width` and `height` that correspond to attributes of the same name on the HTML `img` tag.

If it has, then the image will be stretched (or compressed) to fit within the box because `Image.layout.max_width` is `100%` so the image fills the container.
