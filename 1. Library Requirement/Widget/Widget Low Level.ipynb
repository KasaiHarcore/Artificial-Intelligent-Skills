Instead, static assets are hosted by the webserver, which is the entity that sits between the kernel and the front-end.  This is a problem because it means widgets have components that need to be **installed both in the webserver and the kernel**.  The kernel components are easy to install, because you can rely on the language’s built-in tools.  The static assets for the webserver complicate things, because an extra step is required to let the webserver know where the assets are."
