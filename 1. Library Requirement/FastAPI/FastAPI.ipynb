    "\n",
    "1. The client (browser) creates an **HTTP request**.\n",

    "3. The server receives it, does the work it needs to do.\n",

    "- In HTML, links are typically created with **anchor tags** (`<a ...>`).\n",

    "\n",
    "HTTP was originally designed to be **stateless**:\n",

    "- If you want “memory” (state), the **client** has to keep it and send what’s needed with each new request.\n",

    "# RESTful API Constrain\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a look at how the RESTful approach takes advantage of the web and its tooling for your benefit, profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST stands for **Representation State Transfer**.\n",
    "APIs that meet the REST architectural style constraints are considered **RESTful**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the guiding architectural constraints required for an API to be considered RESTful:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Client–Server\n",
    "- Stateless\n",
    "- Layered System\n",
    "- Cacheable\n",
    "- Uniform Interface\n",
    "- Code on Demand\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like the web, the client makes a request to a server.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **client** is typically your program (not a browser).\n",
    "- You’ll probably use a library to create and send HTTP requests.\n",
    "- The protocol used **HTTP**.\n",
    "\n",
    "And HTTP is stateless. If you want to maintain state (like login details), you must send it with **each** request — usually using **headers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we should talk about what that request was requesting. In REST, the request is typically asking for information about a **resource** (R in URL / URI). A resource is intentionally a little abstract. We use the term resource to reference an object — and that object can represent just about anything we build. Think in resources and collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of what we want to do to resources can be expressed through the unfortunate sounding acronym **CRUD**:\n",
    "- **C**reate\n",
    "- **R**ead\n",
    "- **U**pdate\n",
    "- **D**elete\n",
    "\n",
    "As a user browsing a website, you mostly do “read” operations. You retrieve pages. Your browser sends a **GET** request to a URI, then the server responds. REST APIs follow the same logic, but instead of returning HTML for a page, they usually return **data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These days, the response body is commonly represented as **JSON** (*JavaScript Object Notation*). JSON is a great format for structured and nested data, and pretty much every programming language can convert JSON strings into native objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you recall, HTTP gives us multiple verbs, and REST uses those verbs to clearly state the intention of your request:\n",
    "- Want to retrieve an author? `GET /authors/{id}`\n",
    "- Want to add an author? `POST /authors` (and include the new author data in the request body)\n",
    "- Want to remove an author? `DELETE /authors/{id}`\n",
    "- Want to update an author? often `PATCH /authors/{id}`\n",
    "\n",
    "If an application exposes a REST API, you can interact with it programmatically:\n",
    "- Grab data\n",
    "- Remotely automate tasks\n",
    "- Smoosh together different services\n",

    "# Explore API with Spotify\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to now, we’ve talked about the web in the abstract.\n",
    "Now it’s time to get a little more specific and see what “using an API” looks like in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 1: Find the developer portal\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to a site (any site), scroll around, and look for the nerdy stuff.\n",
    "A lot of companies hide it at the bottom of the page with links like:\n",
    "- `Developers`\n",
    "- `Docs`\n",
    "- `API`\n",
    "- `Developer Portal`\n",
    "\n",
    "On Spotify, you’ll end up at **Spotify for Developers** — and it feels really nice when a company takes care of developers with good documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 2: Choose the Web API (REST over HTTP)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the developer portal you’ll usually see multiple options:\n",
    "- SDKs for iOS / Android\n",
    "- Client libraries\n",
    "- And the one we care about right now: **Web API**\n",
    "\n",
    "Spotify’s Web API is based on REST principles and returns **JSON** about:\n",
    "- Artists\n",
    "- Albums\n",
    "- Tracks\n",
    "- Playlists\n",
    "- And more\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll also see a base URL like `api.spotify.com`, and then a set of **endpoints** (paths) that target different resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 3: Notice the REST patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "As you read the docs, you’ll keep seeing the same patterns we discussed:\n",
    "- `GET` retrieves resources\n",
    "- `POST` creates resources\n",
    "- `PUT`/`PATCH` updates resources\n",
    "- `DELETE` removes resources\n",
    "\n",
    "Spotify also uses a resource identifier style (for example: a **track** has a Spotify ID).\n",
    "Once you have an ID, you can use it in other endpoints to fetch related resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 4: Authorization exists (but we won’t go deep yet)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some endpoints require **authorization** because you shouldn’t be able to modify anyone’s data. Example: you shouldn’t be able to add songs to someone else’s playlist.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Spotify supports authorization (OAuth). For our first exploration, we’ll focus on safe read-only operations like search and browsing publicish data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 5: Use the API Console to explore\n",
    "\n",
    "A really friendly thing some API providers offer is an interactive **console**.\n",
    "Spotify has one, and it lets you:\n",
    "- Pick an endpoint (like Search)\n",
    "- Fill in parameters (like query and type)\n",
    "- Generate a request (often showing a `curl` example)\n",
    "- Click “Try it” and see the JSON response\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 6: Get a token (and don’t leak it)\n",
    "\n",
    "To try requests, you’ll often need an OAuth token.\n",
    "The console can help you create one (you may need to log in or create an account).\n",
    "\n",
    "Important:\n",
    "- Treat tokens like passwords.\n",
    "- Don’t paste them into public places.\n",
    "- If you accidentally expose one, rotate/revoke it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the token is set, click “Try it”.\n",
    "You should get back a JSON response that includes a list of matching artists, including fields like:\n",
    "- Name\n",
    "- Followers\n",
    "- Genres\n",
    "- External URLs\n",
    "- The artist’s Spotify ID\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 7: Follow the resource graph (IDs unlock more endpoints)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have an **artist ID**, you can switch endpoints.\n",
    "For example, you can request the artist’s albums with a path like:\n",
    "- `GET /artists/{id}/albums`\n",
    "\n",
    "That response is also JSON and typically includes:\n",
    "- Album names\n",
    "- Release info\n",
    "- Markets/availability\n",
    "- Images (cover art URLs)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you open one of the image URLs, you’ll see it’s just another resource you can fetch."
