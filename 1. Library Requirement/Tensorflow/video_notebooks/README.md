# Video notebooks
All notebook code written during video recording (notebooks here are exactly how they came from the video lectures during the course).

For ground truth notebooks (notebooks with code + plenty of text-based annotations), see the [course materials](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning#course-materials).
