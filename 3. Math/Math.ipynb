    "\n",
    "- The entries of a vector are the *elements* (entries, coefficients, components) of the vector.\n",
    "- The *size* (or dimension / length) of the vector is the number of elements in the vector. Example with vector $(1.1, 3, -2.4, 5)$:\n",

    "- A vector can be represent by point with arrow on top of it: $\\vec{a}$.\n",
    "- For a subscripted vector, the subscript is the index of the element. Example: with same example above, third element is $a_{3} = -2.4$.\n",
    "- $a_{i}$ is the ith element of the vector $\\vec{a}$.\n",
    "- In an *n-vector*, indexes run ${i} \\in \\{1, 2, ..., n\\}$.\n",

    "In the equation above, we say that $\\vec{b}$, $\\vec{c}$, $\\vec{d}$ are subvectors or slices of $\\vec{a}$, with sizes $m$, $n$, $p$ respectively. Colon notation used to denote subvectors. For example:\n",

    "### 1.3 Scalar-vector multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "Another operation is *scalar multiplication* or *scalar-vector multiplication*. A vector can be multiplied by a scalar (a number) by multiplying each element of the vector by the scalar. For example:\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Inner product (Dot product)\n",
    "\n",
    "The *inner product* or *dot product* of two vectors is a scalar. The dot product of two vectors $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ of the same size is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a^T b = a_{1} b_{1} + a_{2} b_{2} + ... + a_{n} b_{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a^T$ is the transpose of the vector $\\vec{a}$. Some other notations for the dot product are $\\langle \\vec{a}, \\vec{b} \\rangle$ or $\\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{b}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "- $\\hat{f}$ is very close to $f$ when $\\vec{x}$ is close to $\\vec{z}$.\n",
